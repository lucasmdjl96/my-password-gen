    Cookies and using the local storage of your browser allow us to provide a better user experience for you.
    When using the "online mode" we use a 30-day cookie to remember your session, allowing us to recover for you users,
    emails and sites you may have created.
    We also use the local storage of your browser to store information about you individual selections, namely,
    background color and
    last mode (online/offline) used, and your preferences regarding the use of cookies and local storage.
    If you accept the use of cookies, you can opt-out at any time by going to the <a href="/cookies/opt-out"
                                                                                     target="_blank">opt-out page</a>.
    Refusing all cookies will still allow you to use the website in "offline mode", but your choice background color
    will
    not be remembered on the next access. In this case your cookie preference will also not be remembered.
    Refusing cookies, but remembering your choice allows us to remember your cookie preference upon successive accesses
    to the website,
    but implies the use of local storage on your browser to store this preference.
