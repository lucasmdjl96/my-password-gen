    <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
    <p>
        Cookies and the local storage of your browser allow us to provide a better user experience for you.
        When using the "online mode" we use a 30-day cookie to remember your session, allowing us to recover for you
        users,
        emails and sites you may have created.
        We also use the local storage of your browser to store information about you individual selections, namely,
        background color and
        last mode (online/offline) used, and your preferences regarding the use of cookies and local storage.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you accept the use of cookies, you can opt out at any time by going to the <a href="/cookies/opt-out">opt-out
        page</a>. This will also delete every data on the server associated to your session.
        Refusing all cookies will still allow you to use the website in "offline mode", but your choice background color
        will
        not be remembered on the next access. In this case your cookie preference will also not be remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
        The option "Reject, but remember my choice" allows us to remember your cookie preference upon successive
        accesses
        to the website,
        but implies the use of local storage on your browser to store this preference.
