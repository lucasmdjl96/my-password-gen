    <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
    <p>
        Cookies and related technologies allow us to provide a better user experience for you.
        When using the "online mode" we use a 366-day cookie to remember your session, allowing us to recover for you
        users, emails and sites you may have created. These plain texts are stored in the indexedDB in your browser,
        and only their hashes are stored on the server.
        We also use the local storage of your browser to store information about you individual selections, namely,
        background color, last modes (online/offline and file/QR-code) used, and your preferences regarding the use of cookies and
        local storage. We also user service workers to store/retrieve assets to speed up page load.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you accept the use of cookies and related technologies, you can opt out at any time by going to the
        <a href="/cookies/opt-out">opt-out page</a>. This will also delete every data on the server associated to
        your session.
        Refusing all cookies will still allow you to use the website in "offline mode", but your choice background color
        will not be remembered on the next access, nor the users, emails or sites created.
        In this case your cookie preference will also not be remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
        The option "Reject, but remember my choice" allows us to remember your cookie preference upon successive
        accesses to the website, but implies the use of local storage on your browser to store this preference.
