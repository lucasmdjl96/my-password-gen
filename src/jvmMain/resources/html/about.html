    <h1>About this app</h1>
    <h4>
        A webapp for a password generator/manager that never transmits
        your master-password (or any password) outside your device.
    </h4>
    <p>
        The webapp consists of two modes: Online mode and Offline mode;
        your chosen mode can be selected via the toggle on the login page.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Online mode</strong> (which is only available after you accept the cookie policy) communicates with the
        server to remember some of your input data for future accesses. First, a session id is created, stored in the
        database, and then stored as a cookie on your device for 30 days (unless renewed).
    </p>
    <p>
        Every user you create is associated to this session id. All usernames, emails and sites created are sent to the
        server and stored in the database after being hashed, while the password is only stored in your browser's memory.
        When logging in or registering a user, the hash of the username is checked against the database to verify if
        such a username is already associated to your session id.
    </p>
    <p>
        After logging in, the email addresses inserted afterwards are linked to the username in the database, and
        similarly
        the site names inserted are linked to the current email address. This allows the possibility of recovering the
        list
        of emails and sites on future visits. Each successive login will have access to the data stored previously, and
        the
        session id will be updated each time you access the login page with Online mode active (and each time Online
        mode is
        toggled on).
        To recover the plain email addresses and site names an in-browser database is used, linking them to the
        server-side ids.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, the password is generated by hashing a combination of the username, master-password, email and
        site.
        And therefore, the same combination of username, master-password, email and site will always yield the same
        password.
        In this way a secure password can be generated consistently without the master password ever leaving your
        device.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <strong>Offline mode</strong> no communication whatsoever is held with the server. While the functionality is
        almost identical to that of Online mode, everything is stored in your browser's memory, so no usernames, emails
        or
        sites will be remembered. Additionally, in Offline mode changing the email address won't affect the sites saved
        in-memory.
