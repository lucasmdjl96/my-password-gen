    <h1>MyPasswordGen</h1>

    <h2>About this app</h2>

    <p>MyPasswordGen is a webapp for a generating and managing passwords that never transmits any password (not even
    hashed) outside the device.</p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>MyPasswordGen works by generating unique passwords based on 4 factors: a master username and a master
    password, both of which can be set in the log-in page, and an email (or username) and a site name for which
    the password is to be used, both of which can be set in the page after logging-in.</p>

    <p>The password generated is completely determined by these four factors, allowing the user to generate the same
    password across different devices/sessions. Since the password is never stored anywhere, any password will
    allow to proceed to the next page (usernames, email addresses and site names are linked to your session, so
    no other user will be able to see this data), but the password that will be generated will be different for
    each different master password input.</p>

    <p>Once logged in, the user can save/select/delete email addresses for the username they have logged in with
    and, after selecting one of these, they can save/select/delete site names for said email address, all of
    which will be available upon successive log-ins.</p>

    <p>All usernames the user registers are saved according to a session which is stored with a cookie on the
    browser. So clearing the cookies will effectively eliminate all these usernames. To alleviate this, an
    export/import functionality is offered to the user.</p>

    <p>Clicking on the export button while on the log-in page will initiate the download of a file containing all
    the data of the user's session. However, since the usernames are never saved anywhere as plain text, these
    will have to be filled in by the user. This data can then be uploaded via the Import button on the log-in
    page. Uploading this file will override any username of the current session, leaving only those specified in
    the file.</p>

    <p>Clicking on the export button while on the email/site page will initiate the download of a file containing
    all the data of the username that is logged in, including in this case the username. With the same Import
    button as in the previous case this file can later be imported to add the data of said username to the
    current session provided it doesn't already exist.</p>

    <p>Offline functionality is much the same except that no data is ever saved.</p>

    <h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

    <p>ctrl + up / ctrl + down: can be used to move up or down among text input fields</p>

    <p>enter: can be used to advance to the next input, log in, add email/site and generate a password</p>

    <p>alt + enter: on the login page can be used to register a username</p>

    <p>ctrl + enter: on the login page can be used to toggle the online/offline mode switch</p>

    <p>ctrl + backspace: can be used to return to the login page from the email/site page</p>

    <p>ctrl + del: can be used to delete a saved email or site</p>

    <p>ctrl + e: can be used to export session/user data</p>

    <p>ctrl + i: can be used to import session/user data</p>

    <p>ctrl + c: can be used after generating a password to copy it to the clipboard</p>

    <h2>Technical details</h2>

    <p>MyPasswordGen can work in two modes: Online mode and Offline mode; the chosen mode can be selected via the
    toggle on the login page.</p>

    <h4>Online mode (Only available after accepting the cookie policy)</h4>

    <p>In this mode the client communicates with the server to remember some input data for future accesses. First,
    a session id is created, stored in the database, and then stored as a cookie on the browser for a year and a
    day (unless renewed).</p>

    <p>Every user created is associated to this session id. All usernames, emails and sites created are sent to the
    server and stored in the database after being hashed, while the password and the plain username is only
    stored in the browser's memory. When logging in or registering a user, the hash of the username is checked
    against the database to verify if such a username is already associated to the session id.</p>

    <p>After logging in, the email addresses inserted afterwards are linked to the username in the database, and
    similarly the site names inserted are linked to the current email address. This allows the possibility of
    recovering the list of emails and sites on future visits. Each successive login will have access to the data
    stored previously, and the session id will be updated each time you access the login page with Online mode
    active (and each time Online mode is toggled on). To recover the plain email addresses and site names an
    in-browser database is used, linking them to the server-side ids.</p>

    <p>Finally, the password is generated by hashing a combination of the username, master-password, email and site.
    And therefore, the same combination of username, master-password, email and site will always yield the same
    password. In this way a secure password can be generated consistently without the master password ever
    leaving your device.</p>

    <h4>Offline mode</h4>

    <p>No communication whatsoever is held with the server in this mode. While the functionality is almost identical
    to that of Online mode, everything is stored in your browser's memory, so no usernames, emails or sites will
    be remembered for future log-ins. Additionally, in Offline mode changing the email address won't affect the
    sites saved in-memory.</p>
