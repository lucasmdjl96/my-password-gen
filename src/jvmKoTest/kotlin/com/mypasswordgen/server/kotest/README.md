# Tests

Integration property tests for the server. Written according to the
ShouldSpec writing style. Even though the classes
all extend FunSpec, a function "should" has been created to replicate
the ShouldSpec syntax, but with the addition that "should" is added
to the test description.

Common helper functions are grouped in the TestParent.kt file.
